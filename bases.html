												<h3>Some really base-ic maths (Ha! Get it? Oh never mind...)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This article will be about some of the easiest maths you will see on my website, bases. In fact, you are using a device that uses bases. Don't know what I mean? That's right, your computer/tablet/phone! You should probably know by now that electronic devices use binary in their systems. Binary can also be called base 2. It may seem like some useless bunches of 0's and 1's, but they all spell out messages that only computers can read. Our counting system uses base 10. Base 10 means that our system of counting uses 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. If we want to count higher than 9, you know what we do. We "wrap" the ones digit back to 0, and make the tens digit 1, to make 10. But what if two digits of the highest value and second highest value were removed? Then we'd end up with only these digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7...with only these 8 digits, how can we make the number ten? And even if we did in this "base 8", 10 in base 8 would only be 8 in base 10. Therefore, to make 10 in base 10 and convert it to base 8, it'd have to be 12 in base 8.
											</p>
											<p>
												On the other hand, what if we added 6 more digits to base 10? We'd end up with base 16, which is also what computers sometimes use, other than binary. The thing about THIS system, though, is that the digits are now 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F, where A is 10, B is 11, C is 12...Now, 10 in base 16 would be 16 in base 10.
											</p>
											<p>
												Have you ever heard about this computer term: hex colors? This is basically what computers use to interpret colors. They interpret colors using numbers in hexadecimal, hence the name "hex colors". How it works is that each color is assigned 6 digits (not randomly), with the first two representing the amount of red that is in the color, the middle two for how much green, and the last two for how much blue. For example, the color #7f3fb2 contains 7f red, 3f green, and b2 blue. We can convert this back to base 10 to understand base 16 more. You know how the tens digit in base 10 represents how many tens there are in the number? Well, the "tens" digit in base 16 represents how my sixteens there are in the number. We can deduce that the color has (16 * 7) + 15 red, (16 * 3) + 15 green, and (16 * 11) + 2 blue. Simplifying that, we get 127 red, 63 green, and 178 blue. Let's see the final result.

												So, that's about all for bases. Was that a good discovery just now? Bet it was.
