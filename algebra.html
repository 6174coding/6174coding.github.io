												1. Intro &amp; Simultaneous Equations
											</p>
											<p>
												You might think algebra is a freakish type of math that flings random x's and y's at you, and that people always back away from, but no. It's actually quite simple, and can be very useful in many math problems you are given in class. Here is a very simple algebraic problem that anyone would know how to solve: x + 22 = 45. In this case, x is a variable, which means it could be any number until you know its value. In order to solve this problem, you have to use this simple rule: whatever mathematical operation you use on one side of the equation, you must use it on the other side as well. Another good thing to do is to isolate x from other numbers. In the equation x + 22 = 45, x has 22 added to it, and we only want the x part of x + 22 on the left side of the equation, so what we can do is eliminate 22 from that side by subtracting 22. Now we only have x on the left side. But, remember the rule I mentioned earlier? Because we subtracted 22 from the left side, we need to do that on the right side too. Because the right side is just 45, we just do 45 - 22, and that equals 23. Finally, we get x = 23. We have found a value for x (23), which is the only value that works for the equation to be true! Now for some more fun: simultaneous equations. This usually involves two equations with two variables: x and y, in this case. Why they are called simultaneous equations is because you have to solve for x and y at almost the same time. There are two good methods for solving them: substitution, and addition/subtraction of entire equations. Let's use this pair of equations, though you may need to know this first: 2x is really x * 2, 3x is really x * 3, etc. Here we go...
											</p>
											<ol>
												<li>x + y = 14</li>
												<li>4x - 5y = 2</li>
											</ol>
											<p>
												To use substitution for this pair of equations, we need to rearrange the first equation a bit. Let's say we want to isolate y on one side and substitute the resulting value into the other equation. To do that, we subtract x from both sides, resulting in y = 14 - x. This equation is still true, as it is a variation of the original equation. We substitute that into the other equation, and we get: 4x - 5(14 - x) = 2. Bingo! Now we only have one variable to deal with, so we can easily solve for x. Let's simplify the equation first. Using the distributive rule, 5(14 - x) = 70 - 5x. But because there was a minus sign before that 5, the equation would be: 4x - 70 + 5x = 2. Simplifying it deeper would make it 9x - 70 = 2. Add 70 to both sides, and the equation becomes 9x = 72. Divide both sides by 9, and we get the value for x, x = 8. Now we'll substitute x = 8 back into the first equation: 8 + y = 14. Subtract 8 from both sides, and boom, we have y = 6. Now we have the only working values of x and y, x = 8 and y = 6. Problem solved! See? Algebra can be fun! Now, let's use the addition/subtraction of equations method, aka elimination method. For this method, what we want to do is multiply one whole equation so that we can add/subtract it with the other equation, in order to eliminate a variable and leave one behind to solve. Scroll up again to see the equations we are using for this example, if you have already forgotten. Let's say we want to eliminate y. The second equation has -5y in it, and to eliminate y, we need to add 5y to get 0. Luckily, we just have to multiply the first equation by 5, so we get: 5x + 5y = 70. Let's add the second equation to this new equation. In this case, y is eliminated, and we are left with 5x + 4x = 70 + 2. Simplify it to 9x = 72, divide both sides by 9, and x = 8 again (obviously). Substitute that into the first equation, and you know the rest. So y = 6 again, duh. Don't trust me? To check whether the x- and y-values are correct, we have to substitute them in both equations and see if they make the equations true. Doing this, we get 8 + 6 = 14, which is correct, and 32 - 30 = 2, which is also correct. We have successfully proven that we have truly solved the problem!

												2. Quadratic Equations
											</p>
											<p>
												Now that we're done with the very basics, let's move on to something a bit more challenging. Have you ever seen quadratic equations? Basically, a quadratic equation is any algebraic equation with a squared term in it, with no higher exponent. By that, I mean that the equation contains some form of x^2. Let's learn how to solve them now. Here's a simple one as an example: x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0. Here, what we have to do is factorize this equation by using the distributive law. It's quite easy to observe that x * x = x^2. Now we want to find out how we can get 2x + 1. As it turns out, the factorization of the original equation leads to this: (x + 1)(x + 1) = 0. To check whether this works, let's add all the results up. x * x + x * 1 + 1 * x + 1 * 1 = x^2 + x + x + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1. As you can see, this is indeed correct. You could also simplify (x + 1)(x + 1) to just (x + 1)^2. Because (x + 1)^2 = 0, one of the factors must equal 0. In this case, there is only one type of factor, which is x + 1. Therefore x + 1 must equal 0, so x = -1. This is the only value that works. For other more tricky quadratic equations where factorization would simply be ugly, you need to use the quadratic formula, which goes like this: x = (-b &plusmn; &radic;(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a, b, and c are coefficients and constants from the equation. In the previous equation, a would be 1, b would be 2, and c would also be 1. Substituting these values will get you this: x = (-2 &plusmn; &radic;(2^2 - 4 * 1 * 1)) / 2. Simplify the formula until you get two unique solutions or just one. So we have this as follows: x = (-2 &plusmn; &radic;(0)) / 2, and then x = (-2 + 0) / 2 or x = (-2 - 0) / 2, and both lead to x = -1. There are also some cases where this whole formula becomes impossible. You can tell when it is impossible: when the part inside the radical is less than 0. Have you heard about the square root of -1? It is a complex number that doesn't lie on our number line, so there's no way any square root below 0 would be solvable. And there you have it, the basics of algebra, made easy.
